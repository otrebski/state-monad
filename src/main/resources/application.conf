    # single host endpoint is allowed to establish. Must be greater than zero.
    max-connections = 500

    # The minimum number of parallel connections that a pool should keep alive ("hot").
    # If the number of connections is falling below the given threshold, new ones are being spawned.
    # You can use this setting to build a hot pool of "always on" connections.
    # Default is 0, meaning there might be no active connection at given moment.
    # Keep in mind that `min-connections` should be smaller than `max-connections` or equal
    min-connections = 10

    # The maximum number of times failed requests are attempted again,
    # (if the request can be safely retried) before giving up and returning an error.
    # Set to zero to completely disable request retries.
    max-retries = 5

    # The maximum number of open requests accepted into the pool across all
    # materializations of any of its client flows.
    # Protects against (accidentally) overloading a single pool with too many client flow materializations.
    # Note that with N concurrent materializations the max number of open request in the pool
    # will never exceed N * max-connections * pipelining-limit.
    # Must be a power of 2 and > 0!
    max-open-requests = 256

    # The maximum duration for a connection to be kept alive
    # This amount gets modified by a 10 percent fuzzyness to avoid the simultanous reconnections
    # defaults to 'infinite'
    # Note that this is only implemented in the new host connection pool

    pipelining-limit = 1

    # The minimum duration to backoff new connection attempts after the previous connection attempt failed.
    #
    # The pool uses an exponential randomized backoff scheme. After the first failure, the next attempt will only be
    # tried after a random duration between the base connection backoff and twice the base connection backoff. If that
    # attempt fails as well, the next attempt will be delayed by twice that amount. The total delay is capped using the
    # `max-connection-backoff` setting.
    #
    # The backoff applies for the complete pool. I.e. after one failed connection attempt, further connection attempts
    # to that host will backoff for all connections of the pool. After the service recovered, connections will come out
    # of backoff one by one due to the random extra backoff time. This is to avoid overloading just recently recovered
    # services with new connections ("thundering herd").
    #
    # Example: base-connection-backoff = 100ms, max-connection-backoff = 10 seconds
    #   - After 1st failure, backoff somewhere between 100ms and 200ms
    #   - After 2nd, between  200ms and  400ms
    #   - After 3rd, between  200ms and  400ms
    #   - After 4th, between  400ms and  800ms
    #   - After 5th, between  800ms and 1600ms
    #   - After 6th, between 1600ms and 3200ms
    #   - After 7th, between 3200ms and 6400ms
    #   - After 8th, between 5000ms and 10 seconds (max capped by max-connection-backoff, min by half of that)
    #   - After 9th, etc., stays between 5000ms and 10 seconds
    #
    # This setting only applies to the new pool implementation and is ignored for the legacy one.
